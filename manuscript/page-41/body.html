Henry Walke.</em><br>Battles and Leaders of the Civil War</p><p>The Confederate attack was opened on <em>Cincinnati</em>, farthest downstream. Three rams, first the <em>General Bragg</em> and then the <em>Sterling Price</em> and the <em>Sumter</em>, struck the ironclad, inflicting considerable damage. Other Union vessels came to her rescue as rapidly as they could. The <em>Cairo</em> moved from across the river and had her first chance for battle action. As her bow guns were rapidly fired, a ball from the <em>Van Dorn</em> struck near the center gunport, but glanced off without doing damage. Then she turned her attention to the <em>Mound City</em>, a sister ironclad which had been struck by a ram and had had a hole smashed in her starboard forward quarter, accompanying her until she grounded herself.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">As the furious action ended and the Confederates ran back down under the protection of Fort Pillow, the <em>Cairo</em> assisted in running the <em>Mound City</em> onto a shoal</p></div> </div>
