Selfridge, Jr., son of the commandant of the Navy Yard at Mare Island, Calif., was a member of seafaring family. He was dedicated and ambitious, but, as fate would have it, he served mostly on doomed vessels and was unable to get along with his men. Perhaps his fellow seamen had reason to be displeased with him, for he seemed always to flirt with disaster, barely escaping further serious mishap early in the war while experimenting with the crude submarine <em>Alligator</em> on a trial run from the Washington Navy Yard. So bad was his luck that the <em>Cairo’s</em> career ended just 3 months to the day after Selfridge first stepped aboard her.</p></div> </div>
