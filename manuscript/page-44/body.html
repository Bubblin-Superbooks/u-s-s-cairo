Foote.</em><br>Library of Congress</p><p>Next day two of the Union vessels ran down toward Fort Pillow and sighted a Confederate gunboat, the <em>Jeff Thompson</em>, lying under the guns of the fort, but before they could attack, cannoneers opened from above and drove them back. Later in the day, while the <em>Cairo</em> was helping guard the mortar boats, the Confederate fleet appeared and exchanged a few shots before withdrawing.</p><p>A joint attack on Fort Pillow, with troops moving in from the land side, was planned for June 5, but the Southerners upset the schedule. The fort had been ordered evacuated and was virtually empty on the 3d, while on the evening of the 4th demolition teams began applying the torch. By noon of the next day, the Confederate fleet was at Memphis, a shortage of men for the fort having caused the evacuation.</p></div> </div>
